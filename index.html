        <p>Albert Camus (7 November 1913 – 4 January 1960) was a French philosopher, author, and journalist. His views contributed to the rise of the philosophy known as absurdism. He wrote in his essay The Rebel that his whole life was devoted to opposing the philosophy of nihilism while still delving deeply into individual freedom. He won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1957.</p>
        <p>Camus did not consider himself to be an existentialist despite usually being classified as a follower of it, even in his lifetime. In a 1945 interview, Camus rejected any ideological associations: <em>"No, I am not an existentialist. Sartre and I are always surprised to see our names linked."</em></p>
        <p>His work includes plays, novels, movies, poems and essays in which he developed a humanism based on the awareness of the absurdity of the human condition but also the revolt as a response to the absurd, a revolt that leads to action and gives meaning to the world and existence.</p>
